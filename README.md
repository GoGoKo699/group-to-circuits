# Group to circuits

#### by  Ruge Lin

This is a repository for the code in the article *Quantum representation of finite groups*. 

All codes are written in Python. Libraries required:

  - qibo 0.1.10
  - numpy, random, time

#### Usage
This is an example of the application of Variational Quantum Algorithm to transform the 16 elements finite group C2*D4 into quantum circuits.
Details are provided in document.pdf.
The python script can be run directly after all required libraies are installed.
Be patient, we couldn't have a perfect minimization everytime...
